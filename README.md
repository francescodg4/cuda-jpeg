This is an old project (almost 5 years old now) that allowed me to land my first job. It is a benchmark of different implementations of GPU-accelerated JPEG compression for the following software libraries:

* Libjpeg (CPU)
* Libjpeg-turbo (CPU)
* Nvidia nvjpeg-10.2 (GPU)
* Nvidia NPP (GPU)

Tested and deployed on the following Hardware Platforms:

* Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650
* Jetson TX2 (Chipset Tegra X2)
* Jetson Nano (Chipset Tegra X1)

The final report is [here](report.md).
